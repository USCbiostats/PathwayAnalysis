# PathwayAnalysis
A repository for work under Aim 2 of Project 3 of the renewed P01 award.

This currently contains WIP on using local clustering methods on the 'super-network'.

For now, the file SuperNetwork.Rmd walks you through the beginnings of what is going on.

For details of the methods we hope to implement see the files "LocalClusteringThoeryPrimer.xxx"

The file Simple_SIF_network_reactome.RData contains our current version of the 'super-network', S.
